After you’ve spent some time talking through the sticky notes, create a list of the expectations that your group has for their project and how they’ll work together.
Expectations that we recommend also having for your group
* Ask for help when needed
* Be willing to help each other instead of displaying an “it’s not my job” attitude
* Be flexible to assist with group needs
* Consistently communicate about where you are at with the project
* Attend all group meetings, communicating if you need to miss a class ahead of time
* Treat it like a job, not like a typical group project
   * We will be working on a project that may mimic how you will work on a dev team
   * If you consistently do not show up to work or are not doing the tasks that you committed to completing, you may be removed from the course.
